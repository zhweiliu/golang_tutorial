- **Some programming experience.** 
    The code here is pretty simple, but it helps to know something about functions.

- **A tool to edit your code.** 
    ny text editor you have will work fine. Most text editors have good support for Go. The most popular are VSCode (free), GoLand (paid), and Vim (free).

- **A command terminal.** 
    Go works well using any terminal on Linux and Mac, and on PowerShell or cmd in Windows.
